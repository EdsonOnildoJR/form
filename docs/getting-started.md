# Getting Started

## Installation

The first thing we need to do is add the package form as a dependency on `pubspec.yaml`.

```yaml
dependencies:
  form: ^0.0.3+1
```

Now we need to install the form.

```bash
flutter pub get
```

!> Run the command in the same directory as the file `pubspec.yaml`.

?> Alternatively, your editor can support it `flutter pub get`. Check your publisherâ€™s documents to learn more.

## Import

Now, in your Dart code, you can use:

```dart
import 'package:form/form.dart';
```
